                            <p><em>Thank you for choosing Soggy Doggy Mobile to groom your furry loved one! We want to let you know we do everything in our power to keep your pet safe, clean and happy! Working with live animals and sharp objects means anything can happen so before allowing us to groom your pet we ask that you agree to the following policies below.</em></p>
                            <p>If you do not agree with any of the items listed below please kindly call us to cancel your appointment or call to speak with someone in the office at <strong>210-777-7316</strong></p>
                            <p>-I agree that my pet is fit and healthy, any grooming which takes place on an elderly or infirm pet will be at the owner's risk. Grooming may expose pre-existing health\skin conditions for which Soggy Doggy Mobile cannot be held liable.</p>
                            <p>-I agree I have informed Soggy Doggy Mobile about any pre-existing health or behavioral issues my pet may have such as but not limited to; Seizures, Heart issues, Tumors, Cancer, Worms, Viruses, Diarrhea, Anxiety, Aggression, Biting, Sensitivities, Being kicked out of a previous salon, and more.</p>
                            <p>-Failure to let Soggy Doggy Mobile or the groomer aware of any pre-existing issues which result in injury may hold pet owners liable to any medical costs.</p>
                            <p>-I agree my pet's rabies vaccine is up to date (as required by law) unless otherwise discussed.</p>
                            <p>-I agree that if my pet bites the groomer we reserve the right to report the incident to animal control, which may cause your pet to be quarantined. If your pet is aggressive it is your duty to let Soggy Doggy Mobile or your groomer know so we can be properly prepared.</p>
                            <p>-In the event of an emergency, in your absence, you authorize Soggy Doggy Mobile to contact the nearest Veterinarian and authorize the Vet to treat the pet as necessary at your expense. If your pet is injured by the groomer and is the fault of the groomer Soggy Doggy Mobile will cover any needed veterinarian services.</p>
                            <p>-I agree that payment is to be made at the time of service. We accept cash or credit card but NO checks unless you are an existing client. Returned checks will incur a $35 charge. For certain situations, if the client is not home we can take payment over the phone as long as we are able to get the pet back inside their home safely.</p>
                            <p>-I understand that nail cutting and ear cleaning are part of the service unless the process is too stressful for the pet or too dangerous for the groomer.</p>
                            <p>-I understand Soggy Doggy Mobile does NOT offer internal anal gland expression, as this should be performed by a licensed veterinarian. Glands are expressed externally which may not completely empty the sack and your pet may still need to see a veterinarian.</p>
                            <p>-â€œDe-matting" or complete coat removal will dramatically alter your pet's appearance. It may be necessary to shave down if the pets coat is neglected and not able to be brushed out. This procedure may expose pre-existing health\skin problems or cause abrasions to the skin for which Soggy Doggy Mobile cannot be held liable.</p>
                            <p>-I understand I may be subject to extra de-matting fees for having the groomer spend extra time brushing or shaving the pets coat.</p>
                            <p>-I understand Soggy Doggy Mobile may take pictures of my pet and post them to their social media. -I understand my groomer may run behind the scheduled appointment time or even early. Soggy Doggy Mobile and the groomer will do everything they can to keep you updated and informed.</p>
                            <p>-I understand it is a possibility Soggy Doggy Mobile could run into mechanical issues with their mobile salon that may cause my appointment to have to be rescheduled. If this happens we will call you immediately.</p>
                            <p>-I understand that any issues I might have with my pets haircut should be addressed at check out. If my groomer leaves and has to come back I may incur extra charges.</p>
                            <p>-Cancellations -Cancellation and rescheduling of an appointment, by the client, requires 24 hours notice to waive the 50$ last-minute cancellation appointment fee. Our loving groomers depend on having appointments scheduled since they are paid by commission and not the hour.</p>
                            <p>-In the event of inclimate weather, a family emergency or any other uncontrollable circumstance, the groomer has the discretion to waive the fee within the 24 hour period.</p>
                            <p>-We reserve the right to cancel or reschedule a groom if we feel the need to do so. Every effort will be made to reschedule at a time convenient for both the client and the groomer.</p>
                            <p>No-Shows-It is considered a "no-show" when the client is not available at the scheduled appointment time and does not contact the groomer to cancel or reschedule.</p>
                            <p>-I understand prices are subject to change at any time.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>*We reserve the right to refuse service to any pet or client for any reason.*</p>
                            <p><strong>THANK YOU!!</strong></p>
