                            <h3>What is mobile grooming?</h3>
                            <p class="px-3">It is professional grooming self-contained in a custom van that arrives at your door to take care of your pup's grooming needs. Mobile dog grooming is preferred by most of today's busy pet owners. The convenience for you and the exclusive attention for your pet make it desirable to use our mobile dog grooming service.  The inverter furnishes electricity to the dryer, table, clippers, A/C, vacuum, lights and more.  A hot water heater ensures the perfect bath temperature and a therapeutic bathing system cleans and soothes your pet.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>But isn't mobile grooming expensive?</h3>
                            <p class="px-3">You will pay more for mobile grooming. But the benefits far outweigh the additional cost.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Why should I choose mobile grooming?</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mobile grooming is convenient.</li>
                                <li>We come right to your doorstep.</li>
                                <li>No car sickness.</li>
                                <li>You save Time and Gas.</li>
                                <li>NO soggy doggies in your car!</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Can I be in the truck with you when you groom my dog?</h3>
                            <p class="px-3">In our experience, this is usually not a good idea. You are your dog's favorite person, so when you are present during grooming, your dog will be focused on you and not on sitting still for or cooperating with the service. There may be some occasions where the dog's owner will be called upon to help calm or hold the dog during certain parts of the service, but generally the grooming should be a one-on-one experience between the dog and the groomer.</p>
                            <br>

                    <p><strong>CANCELLATION POLICY/NO SHOW/TRIP FEE:</strong> If Client cannot keep their appointment,  they must contact Soggy Doggy no less than 24 hours prior to their scheduled appointment. <strong>Failure to call 24 hours before your appointment or failure to have your pet available at the scheduled time will result in a charge of $50.</strong> All clients who have scheduled appointments for  multiple pets, who decide not to groom one of their pets, without at least 24 hours notice, will be  responsible for part of or all the cancelled pet's grooming charge. <strong>Clients will be charged a $50  fee for missed scheduled appointments.</strong></p>
                    <p>Soggy Doggy will send a courtesy text or call prior to Client's scheduled appointment to confirm  the appointment. Once the Soggy Doggy groomer arrives at your residence, if you are not home  or do not answer the door, the Soggy Doggy groomer is not required to wait beyond the  scheduled appointment time for you to arrive. </p>
                    <p>If You are a first time Soggy Doggy client and You miss a scheduled appointment, Soggy Doggy  has the right to not schedule future appointments for You and your pets. </p>

                    <p><strong>APPOINTMENT TIMES:</strong> As a mobile service, Soggy Doggy's schedule is subject to  interruptions and delays, including, but not limited to: traffic, driving distance from previous appointments, and prior appointments taking longer than anticipated. Because of these possible  delays, appointment times are estimated times of arrival. The Soggy Doggy groomer will arrive  within a 3-hour window of the scheduled appointment time. However, Soggy Doggy will make  every effort to arrive at the scheduled location at the scheduled time. </p>
                    <p><strong>MAT REMOVAL:</strong> Allowing your pet's coat to get matted is not only very uncomfortable but  dangerous for your pet's health. Pets with matted coats need extra attention during their grooming  session. Removing a matted coat can be a painful, time-consuming, and costly procedure.  Removing matting may cause severe discomfort for your pet and can aggravate or cause skin  problems in your pet. The process of removing matting on a pet involves certain risks. Nicks, cuts,  or abrasions are possible during the mat removal process due to moles, warts, or skin folds trapped  in the matted hair. The Soggy Doggy groomer will use their discretion to determine if it is safe to  remove your pet's matting. If the Soggy Doggy groomer decides that removing matting is unsafe  for your pet, You will be contacted for approval to shave your pet's coat. </p>
                    <p>Shaving your pet may dramatically change your pet's appearance and the hair will be very close to  the skin. This may expose pre-existing skin conditions. Closely shaved pets are also prone to  sunburn. Shaved pets should either have sunscreen applied daily or be kept out of the sun until the  hair grows back sufficiently to protect your pet's skin. In some cases, pets may also exhibit brief  behavioral changes. For pets of certain breeds and coat types, the pet's coat may not grow back the same. </p>
                    <p>Heavy matting can also trap moisture near your pet's skin. This trapped moisture can cause skin  irritation or the growth of mold, fungus, and bacteria. The after-effects of mat removal procedures may include itchiness, skin redness, self-inflicted irritations or abrasions, or failure of hair to re grow. Client understands they are responsible for the condition of their pet's coat and Client will  not hold Soggy Doggy responsible for any adverse effects of mat removal. Client may be subject to  and responsible for extra fees for the time it takes to safely remove the matting of the pet's coat. </p>
                    <p><strong>AGGRESSIVE/DANGEROUS PETS:</strong> Client must inform Soggy Doggy prior to grooming if  their pet has bitten someone or has aggressive tendencies or a history of aggression. Client may be subject to additional fees for the extra time it takes Soggy Doggy to safely groom an aggressive pet. Soggy Doggy will not accept any overly aggressive pet. If Soggy Doggy learns that a Client  misrepresented or lied about the aggressiveness or behavior of their pet, or if a pet acts in an  aggressive manner towards a Soggy Doggy employee, Soggy Doggy reserves the right to  discontinue grooming services, even if such services have already begun. Soggy Doggy may use  muzzles if necessary. Muzzling will not harm your pet and protects both the pet and the groomer. If  Soggy Doggy has to discontinue grooming services pursuant to this paragraph, Client will still be  responsible for the full grooming charge. Client will be liable for any bites, personal injury, or  property damage caused by their pet(s). If Client's pet bites the Soggy Doggy groomer Soggy  Doggy reserves the right to report the incident to the local animal control. For the Soggy Doggy's  employee's safety, as well as your pet(s)'s, Soggy Doggy has the right to refuse service in the  event a pet cannot be handled safely. If your pet is overly aggressive or presents a danger to Soggy  Doggy's employees, Soggy Doggy may not schedule future appointments for your pet's grooming.</p>
                    <p><strong>SENIOR PETS, PETS WITH HEALTH ISSUES, AND PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS:</strong> Grooming procedures can be stressful, especially for a senior pet or a pet with health problems.  Because senior pets and pets with health problems have a greater chance of injury, these pets will  be groomed for cleanliness and comfort, in styles and using procedures intended to limit the pet's stress. Soggy Doggy will not be responsible for accidental injury or death to an elderly or health compromised pet while the pet is in the possession and control of Soggy Doggy. Client may be  subject to additional fees for any extra time it may take to safely handle the senior or health compromised pet. Soggy Doggy will not be responsible for medical expenses caused by a pet's  pre-existing health conditions, even if such condition is aggravated or exacerbated by Soggy  Doggy's grooming services. </p>
                    <p><strong>FLEA AND TICK INFESTATION/SALON SANITATION:</strong> If fleas or ticks are found on your  pet, Soggy Doggy will administer a flea and tick shampoo to your pet to help rid them of the fleas  and ticks. This treatment is mandatory, and an additional charge will apply. Soggy Doggy  administers this treatment not only to rid your pet of the fleas and ticks but to prevent an infestation  within the Soggy Doggy mobile grooming salon. Client is aware that any treatments administered  are not guaranteed to be one hundred percent effective and proper flea and tick treatment and  prevention is Client's responsibility. If Client's pet(s) are regularly infested with fleas or ticks at  the time of grooming services, Soggy Doggy may refuse to continue scheduling Client's pet(s) for  grooming services. </p>
                    <p><strong>PUPPY'S FIRST GROOMING:</strong> The first grooming for a puppy, or any age dog, can be  especially stressful for the pet. Additional time may be required for working with younger pets or  pets new to grooming. Clients can help their pets become more comfortable with the grooming  process by regularly massaging their pet's paws and brushing or combing their coats. </p>
                    <p><strong>PICTURES AND MARKETING:</strong> You consent to your pet(s) being photographed and You  authorize Soggy Doggy, it's employees, agents, and authorized representatives to use, publish,  reproduce, edit, transmit, distribute, and display such photographs on or in Soggy Doggy's mobile  grooming salon(s), website, or other promotional, marketing, or advertising material. The use of  any images remain loyalty free indefinitely and on a voluntary basis and is not considered work for  hire. Nor does the photographing of your pet and use of those photographs by Soggy Doggy create  any type of employee/employer relationship, joint venture, independent contractor, or other type of  contractual or working relationship between You and Soggy Doggy. </p>
                    <p><strong>ACCIDENTS:</strong> There is always the possibility that an accident could occur. Grooming equipment  is sharp. Even though Soggy Doggy uses extreme caution and care while grooming your pet(s) possible problems could occur, including: cuts, nicks, scratches, etc. In most cases accidents occur  when a pet is wiggling or moving around. Every effort will be made to ensure the safety of your  pet. To help with preventing accidents, You agree that, unless authorized by the Soggy Doggy  groomer, you will not allow your pet to see or hear you, as such stimulation could cause your pet to  move around. </p>
                    <p>*We reserve the right to refuse service to any pet or client for any reason.*</p>
